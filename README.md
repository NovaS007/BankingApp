# Java Banking App

A simple **text-based banking system** developed as part of my *Program Design 1* class. This project is **rudimentary** by design and represents my **first real hands-on experience** with Java and object-oriented programming.

It includes:
- Basic account management (checking and savings)
- Reading/writing data to and from files
- Randomized account number generation
- Basic analytics: finding accounts by number, calculating averages, etc.

This project serves as a **learning milestone** and foundation for future improvements. I may return to expand and refactor it as my skills grow.
